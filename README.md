## Notes

### Course 01 - Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software

#### Module 01 - Introduction to the Course

- [Course Website: Build Software Applications - Duke University](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/index.php)

#### Module 02 - Fundamental Java Syntax and Semantics

- [Course Class Documentation](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/doc/)
- Module Learning Outcomes:
  1. Download and run BlueJ (Java IDE for the course; hides a lot of tooling complexity)
  2. Access the documentation for the Java libraries designed for the course
  3. Edit, compile, and run a Java program
  4. Construct methods, variables, if/else statements, and for each loops in Java
  5. Use `Iterables` to run a program that iterates over multiple lines in document or webpage or multiple files in a directory

#### Module 03 - Strings in Java

- Bunch of String pattern matching, basic loops (`for`, `while`), and conditionals (>, <, ==, !=, &&, ||)

#### Module 04 - CSV Files and Basic Statistics in Java

- Module Learning Outcomes
  1. Use Apache Commons CSV package
  2. Access data from one or many CSV files in Java
  3. Convert strings into numbers
  4. Use of `null`
  5. Design algorithms to process CSV data

#### Module 05 - MiniProject: Baby Name & Batch Grayscale and Image Inversion

- More practice reading documentation and File IO processing and manipulation

### Course 02 - Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data (14 hours)

#### Module 01 - Welcome (18 mins)

- Module Learning Outcomes:
  1. Combine String using concatenation (already practiced this extensive in the previous course ð®âð¨)
  2. Build Strings within a Java Program using StringBuilder
  3. Use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data
  4. Refactor your programs for improved organization using OOP
  5. Practice effective algorithm design
- `StringBuilder` class provides for an efficient construction of Strings
  - Provides a **mutable** sequence of characters
  - Single quotes in Java create `char` primitive types. Double quotes in Java create `String` reference type.
    - Example: `'a'` is a char primitive type
    - Example: `"hello"` is a String reference type

#### Module 02 - Cryptography: Keeping Information Secret

#### Module 03 - GladLibs: Stories from Templates (3 hours)

#### Module 04 - Web Server Logs: From Logs to Visits (3 hours)

#### Module 05 - MiniProject: Vigenere Cipher (2 hours)

### Course 03 - Object Oriented Programming in Java (40 hours)

### Course 04 - Data Structures and Performance (41 hours)
