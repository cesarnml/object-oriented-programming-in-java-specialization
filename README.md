## Notes

### Course 01 - Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software

#### Module 01 - Introduction to the Course

- [Course Website: Build Software Applications - Duke University](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/index.php)

#### Module 02 - Fundamental Java Syntax and Semantics

- [Course Class Documentation](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/doc/)
- Module Learning Outcomes:
  1. Download and run BlueJ (Java IDE for the course; hides a lot of tooling complexity)
  2. Access the documentation for the Java libraries designed for the course
  3. Edit, compile, and run a Java program
  4. Construct methods, variables, if/else statements, and for each loops in Java
  5. Use `Iterables` to run a program that iterates over multiple lines in document or webpage or multiple files in a directory

#### Module 03 - Strings in Java

- Bunch of String pattern matching, basic loops (`for`, `while`), and conditionals (>, <, ==, !=, &&, ||)

#### Module 04 - CSV Files and Basic Statistics in Java

- Module Learning Outcomes
  1. Use Apache Commons CSV package
  2. Access data from one or many CSV files in Java
  3. Convert strings into numbers
  4. Use of `null`
  5. Design algorithms to process CSV data
